**Session Summary**: Upstream sync completed: fetched gomuks releases v26.03 through v26.09 (v0.2603.0 through v0.2609.0), merged as separate commits on branch upstream-sync, main fast-forwarded to merge base (head 91d2f022 pushed). 0.7.0 released (minor bump due to upstream OAuth MSC removal + app fingerprint change). Post-merge echo changes: Inter 4.1 variable fonts bundled (web/src/fonts/, removes Google Fonts link), outgoing messages carry "app.gomuks": "echo" (was "web") unless hide-fingerprint pref on, "Request key" now ResultModal-styled, composer Tab no longer moves focus (preventDefault unless IME composing), macOS webview configured with allowsInlinePredictions (function macos_webview_configuration in lib.rs, new deps objc2 0.6 and objc2-web-kit 0.3, user confirmed inline predictions work + Tab accepts them). Release 0.7.0 had one hiccup (push rejected, .github/workflows changed, fix: restore echo's copies, move unpushed tag v0.7.0 to new commit, push main + tag manually, create release manually with gh). 19 unreleased upstream commits after v26.09 not merged (later sync can pick them up incremental). Untracked work-state files ready for checkpoint update. Tree clean, dev app stopped.

**Decisions Made**:
- Merge upstream by tag with real merges (not cherry-picks): incremental and downstream-compatible
- Conflict rule: keep echo's visual, take upstream's behaviour
- Upstream visual-only changes (theme colors, padding, room-name weight, Inter tuning) left out
- Compact room list option (v26.09) kept
- Keep echo's .github/workflows copies rather than grant token workflow scope
- Only "Request key" moved off window.alert; other menu alerts remain for styling pass

**Actions Taken**:
- Fetched upstream via git fetch; merged upstream/main v0.2603.0 through v0.2609.0 by tag with --no-ff
- Merge conflicts resolved per rule (visual kept as echo, behaviour taken from upstream)
- web/package-lock.json: took upstream's, restored echo's @tauri-apps/* and react-colorful versions, ran npm install
- Verified: go build -tags goolm,sqlite_fts5, tsc, npm run lint, vitest, production build all clean
- Rebuilt dev sidecar: go build -tags goolm,sqlite_fts5 -o web/src-tauri/binaries/gomuks-aarch64-apple-darwin ./cmd/gomuks
- Resolved .github/workflows to echo's side before pushing
- Kept echo's pkg/hicli/pushrules.go isInviteForMe gate
- Release 0.7.0: npm build, go build, tauri build, sign, notarize, staple (all verified + GitHub release)
- Updated .claude/work/current.md, constraints.md, log.md, questions.md
- Updated learnings files: release-pipeline.md, dev-environment-gotchas.md, tauri-macos-chrome.md
- Created new learnings file upstream-sync.md with sync procedure

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Upstream sync as separate commits keeps history readable and allows later syncs to start from v26.09
- Workflow-scope rejection resolved elegantly: echo's CI never runs (Actions disabled); keeping local copies is simpler than expanding token perms
- OAuth device code is upstream's design (MAS integration); echo just passes client_name: "echo"
- Variable Inter 4.1 was chosen over static set because weight 600 (sender names) is out of upstream's range
- Tab accept inline predictions is unverified by user live (user said "seems to work"); needs production testing
- DB schema v27 is upstream-driven; no action needed, just a consequence of the sync
- 19 unreleased upstream commits will be picked up on the next sync (no rush to cherry-pick now)
- All durable constraints recorded in constraints.md with 2026-09-24 date

## 2026-09-21 17:22

**Session Summary**: One long session spanning 08:40–17:22 PDT. Released 0.6.0 (minor: f9795a08 "chrome: unified title bar, Inter throughout, blue/red unread ramp, Recent sub-filter" containing batch-1 fixes, unread retune, and login redesign from 2026-09-20) and 0.6.1 (patch: disconnected screen, loading-state sweep, release notes rewrite). Both shipped: app and DMG notarized/Accepted, feed verified serving both versions. Penguin logomark is echo original (not upstream gomuks). DisconnectedScreen renders full-window opaque skeleton under filter:blur(3px) with centred box and penguin lockup; different from first-sync SyncBox (which stays bare). Loading unified to one @keyframes sk-sweep animation app-wide with HairlineWait for unknown-shape states; react-spinners removed entirely. 20 UI sites converted from spinners. Durable constraints recorded for all new patterns (skeleton animation, loading idioms, disconnected screen, reduce-motion gates, token scoping). Favicon mismatch (still gomuks.png) deferred to next session.

**Decisions Made**:
- 0.6.0 released as minor (user convention: feature addition + setting removal = minor)
- Skeleton animation unified: one @keyframes sk-sweep; all placeholders use .sk class; no per-file shimmer ever re-added
- Two loading idioms only: skeleton (shape known) or HairlineWait (shape unknown); react-spinners completely removed
- DisconnectedScreen opaque full-window skeleton (frozen UI), never blur (blurred would imply broken); centred box with quick-switcher styling; penguin lockup below
- Penguin is echo's own logo (web/src-tauri/icons/echo.icon/, 256px downscale web/src/icons/echo-penguin.png); upstream gomuks files are leftovers
- release.sh gh token pinning to taylorbird prevents account-drift 403s during multi-account scenarios
- Reduce-motion gates: @media + data-ignore-reduce-motion override pair; animations disabled on user's ON-by-default machine
- --room-list-width declared on main.matrix-main (not :root); fixed layers outside main use --space-bar-width

**Actions Taken**:
- 0.6.0: rewrite RELEASE_NOTES.md (title bar removed, Inter, unread vs mention, Recent sub-filter, per-room colours gone, read-receipts known)
- Release: git tag v0.6.0 && release.sh minor (full pipeline: version bump, npm build, go build, tauri build, sign, notarize, staple DMG separately, latest.json, push, GitHub release)
- DisconnectedScreen: NEW web/src/ui/DisconnectedScreen.tsx/.css (opaque skeleton, filter blur, rgba overlay, centred box, penguin lockup in grid)
- Loading unified: NEW Loading.css (@keyframes sk-sweep, .sk base + weights, reduce-motion gate); NEW loading/index.tsx (SkeletonLine/Name/Circle/Block/Edge/Row, HairlineWait)
- Removed react-spinners from package.json/lockfile (npm uninstall)
- Fixed --tertiary-text-color light mode (#9a9a9a, 2.8:1 contrast ratio)
- Converted 20 render sites to skeleton/HairlineWait: EventContextModal, EventEditHistory, SettingsView Monaco, LazyWidget, UserInfo*, RoomPreview, maps/async, RoomList post-reconnect, load-more buttons (3 sites), URLPreview description, ConfirmModal, MediaMessageBody, TypingNotifications
- Fix (7a596c37): room-list.skeleton + placeholder rows both tied to skeletonRows > 0; prevents >12-room reconnect scroll lock
- 0.6.1: rewrite RELEASE_NOTES.md (disconnected screen, loading vocabulary); git tag v0.6.1 && release.sh patch
- Verified both 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 feed live

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Design artifacts for choices: "Reconnect Screen Placement" (cards A–H variant; user picked F, iterated to H with box); "Loading States Sweep" (4×5 grid; user picked Hairline/Skeleton/Skeleton/Text)
- Skeleton animation now standardized; future regressions to shimmer or spinners must be rejected at review
- DisconnectedScreen opaque (frozen UI unresponsive) not blurred (blurred reads as broken/glitchy); penguin lockup is Easter egg + visual anchor
- SyncBox (first sync) stays bare by design; deliberately differs from disconnected screen (first-sync skeleton is live and worth watching)
- Penguin: 256px downscale via `sips -Z 256`; source in web/src-tauri/icons/echo.icon/
- Favicon mismatch (web/index.html:5 gomuks.png) is one-line fix, deferred; Dock and browser disagree
- 0.6.1 is first production build with DisconnectedScreen + loading module; WKWebView divergence possible (history: fetch_og_tags, external links, clipboard had quirks)
- Tree clean at checkpoint; dev app not running (no token risk)

## 2026-09-21 08:33

**Session Summary**: Session consisted of bringing the local dev app back online after finding all processes down overnight (tauri dev, app window, sidecar all exited at some point). No code was written and no decisions were made. Dev app was relaunched with tauri dev, fresh 24h backend token minted at ~08:29 PDT (expires ~08:29 on 2026-09-22). All uncommitted work from prior session remains intact: 14 modified files, 1 deletion (WebAuthLogin.css), 3 new untracked files (SyncBox.tsx/css, SignedOut.css), HEAD still f9795a08.

**Decisions Made**:
- None

**Actions Taken**:
- Relaunched dev app with `/Users/tbird/gomuks/web/node_modules/.bin/tauri dev` (correct invocation, logged to session scratchpad)
- Verified healthy: Vite on 6173, backend on 29325, all three processes running, fresh 24h token minted

**Context/Thoughts**:
- All uncommitted work ready for next session (commit, retest, version decision, release)
- Backend token expires 2026-09-22 ~08:29 PDT

## 2026-09-20 23:21

**Session Summary**: Three parallel work streams over 2026-09-18 evening into 2026-09-20. Stream 1: Batch 1 pre-release fixes (rail avatar, preference description, toReversed() floor, Recent header removal) — all verified still-relevant in source before being made, tsc+eslint clean, uncommitted. Stream 2: unread-colour retune (blue neon family #5cbbff/#85d6ff, inverted dark text for counted badges, glow removed from base-tier dot) — user's visual direction, uncommitted. Stream 3: full redesign of loading and signed-out screens via design artifacts (four published variants) then implementation — Plain picked for signed-out, Skeleton+Hairline for loading; six files new/modified/deleted; SyncBox with three states, SignedOut wrapper, WebAuthLogin rewritten as backend-session screen, LoginScreen restyled Plain, skeleton placeholders, restartApp() helper added, all uncommitted, tsc+eslint clean. Four new durable constraints recorded. Seven learnings items identified for extension into existing topic files.

**Decisions Made**:
- Batch 1 fixes verified and ready: avatar, preference description, toReversed(), Recent header removal
- Unread blue retune matches neon family; inverted dark ink on lighter blue; base dot no glow
- Design picks: Plain for signed-out, Skeleton+Hairline for loading (user selections overrode design agent's recommendations)
- Pre-app screens: one surface with no app shell, shared .signin-column styles, SyncBox inline in grid
- Progress colour aliases unread-blue to decouple from badge retune
- Next action: commit all three streams, retest signed-out/loading screens visually, version decision + release

**Actions Taken**:
- Batch 1: fixed rail avatar (RoomList.tsx), preference description (preferences.ts), toReversed()→reverse() (RoomList.tsx), Recent header removed (forced isCollapsed false, section headerless, added padding-top)
- Unread retune: blue tokens in index.css, --unread-counter-blue-text in RoomList.css, box-shadow:none on dot, --progress-color alias
- Redesign: NEW SyncBox.tsx/.css, NEW SignedOut.css, REWROTE WebAuthLogin.tsx (backend-session flow), REWROTE LoginScreen.tsx (Plain), DELETED WebAuthLogin.css, modified App.tsx (wrapper), MainScreen.tsx (grid), RoomList.tsx (skeleton), updater.ts (restartApp helper)

**Context/Thoughts**:
- All changes uncommitted, ready for verification; tsc and eslint clean across all files.
- Batch 1 fixes: small, verified, ready to ship; avatar fetch pattern already exists in UserInfo.tsx.
- Design process: four published artifacts narrowed to two picks; user's direction (Plain + Skeleton+Hairline) overrode design agent's recommendations, a healthy sign.
- SyncBox grid placement via grid-area:roomview avoids positioning-context/contain:strict risks.
- Backend session expires after 24h; app running longer than a day hits unanswered credentials form (relaunch is only remedy now).
- Learnings to extend: backend-auth.md (24h token), css-layering.md (--inverted-text-color scoping), dev-gotchas.md (npm run tauri dev trap), gomuks-frontend-structure.md (no SyncStatus fraction), tauri-acl.md (restartApp mechanism).
- Release is still blocked on version decision (patch vs minor) and user retest of new screens.

## 2026-09-18 09:53

**Session Summary**: Third checkpoint spanning 2026-09-17 evening into 2026-09-18. All 2026-09-17 UI work was committed (commit f9795a08 "chrome: unified title bar, Inter throughout, blue/red unread ramp, Recent sub-filter" — 32 files) and pushed to origin/main; working tree is CLEAN. `RELEASE_NOTES.md` was fully rewritten for the release (title bar removed, one typeface Inter, unread vs mention split, Recent sub-filter, per-room colours removed, space-selected-but-collapsed fix, known read-receipts issue); it is committed and ready verbatim for release feed. `scripts/release.sh` has NOT been run. No version bump occurred; both version files still say 0.5.1. Release is PAUSED awaiting two user decisions: (1) **Version:** patch (0.5.2) or minor (0.6.0) — Claude's read is "minor" (removes a preference, adds a feature) but user's 0.5.1 convention (full visual overhaul as patch) takes precedence. (2) **Push-review findings:** three code issues found by user's /push-review command after git push: (a) stale `room_list_color` preference description at preferences.ts ~136 references the deleted `uniform_room_list_color` preference and renders in Settings (one-line fix), (b) `roomList.toReversed()` in RoomList.tsx uses Array.prototype.toReversed (macOS 13.3+ only, no minimumSystemVersion declared, TypeError if floor crossed), equivalent `[...roomList].reverse()` exists (low practical risk if user is 13.3+, but should fix), (c) Recent section header renders collapsible "Recent" title (redundant with rail label, empties view when collapsed) — UX issue. External tester ("wreck" on Matrix, using 0.5.1 or earlier) submitted feedback with three categories: **VERIFIED REAL BUGS**: rail profile avatar `getAvatarThumbnailURL(client.userID)` passes no UserProfile content so it can only ever show letter tile (structurally impossible to load), fix: fetch profile once and pass as content (small change); **STRUCTURAL DESIGN PROBLEM**: DM sub-filter is permanently empty inside real spaces (DMs are never `m.space.child` edges, only Home/orphans see DMs), making 2–3 of 4 sub-filters dead weight — options A–D presented (A: hide empty sub-filters; B: redefine DMs as "DMs with people in this space"; C: hide sub-filters except Home/orphans; D: empty-state copy), Claude recommended A now + B later. **LIKELY ALREADY FIXED**: lightbox image tools were cut off by removed title-bar band (fixed in f9795a08). **CONTAMINATED**: CSS alignment complaint disputed by tester himself (custom CSS from another gomuks install). **NEEDS REPRODUCTION**: spaces-only-after-reload (most concerning, smells like sync race), URL-preview scroll anchor, multi-line composer expansion, discoverability (home vs triangle tiles). **KNOWN UPSTREAM**: slow first sync (no sliding sync v2), SSO passkey/WebAuthn (upstream OAuth MSC), cross-signing UX. Blue/red unread ramp has never been visually seen by anyone (no unread rooms in screenshot). Two design questions raised by Claude: (1) lavender section header (#bd93f9 tinted) now the only purple left with white room names; should be neutralized? (2) sender names in previews are per-user coloured (different system from removed per-room accent), now the most colourful thing in room list; quiet them?

**Decisions Made**:
- UI work 2026-09-17 is shipped as commit f9795a08 to origin/main
- Release is PAUSED on version decision (patch vs minor) and three push-review findings
- External tester feedback received and triaged into: verified bugs (avatar), structural issue (DM spaces), likely fixed (lightbox), contaminated (CSS), needs repro (three unknowns)

**Actions Taken**:
- Updated `.claude/work/current.md`: Last Checkpoint to 2026-09-18 09:53, Current Focus rewrote to state release paused on version and push-review, Next Actions (Desktop) prioritized as: cut release, fix preference description, fix avatar, decide space filter, reproduce unknowns, decide header/colours, read receipts, Cotypist
- Updated `.claude/work/constraints.md`: added 2026-09-18 entries: RELEASE_NOTES.md rewrite discipline, toReversed() floor constraint, space membership fact
- Updated `.claude/work/questions.md`: added new "Tester feedback" section and two design questions

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Release is genuinely blocked: if cut without addressing avatar bug, tester's second feedback will show it broken; version bumping is user's call (0.5.1 set precedent for large visual overhaul as patch).
- Avatar bug is small (add one RPC fetch) but user-visible in rail profile; worth fixing before shipping.
- toReversed() floor is low practical risk (user likely 13.3+) but should be fixed for breadth (global CLAUDE rule: this codebase constraint now recorded).
- Space DM problem is structural: the sub-filter exists but is permanently empty. User hasn't seen the issue yet (was on 0.5.1, no Recent feature). Option A (hide empty filters) is minimal; Claude recommends it now, B (smarter DM definition) for next session.
- Tester's three unknowns (spaces-reload, scroll, composer) are lower priority but the reload race sounds real and is worth reproducing.
- Blue/red ramp has never been seen. Release notes claim it works, but visual verification would be good (needs room with unread messages to test).
- Two design questions (header colour, preview colours) are opened by Claude for user decision, not blockers.
- Session is checkpoint-only, no code changes made.

## 2026-09-17 15:53

**Session Summary**: Second checkpoint of the day (post-15:15 work). All changes remain UNCOMMITTED; zero tsc/eslint errors maintained. Three major changes executed: (1) **Per-room colours removed entirely** — user asked for white room names and to "eliminate the feature where you can have different room colors"; investigation showed `--room-accent` (hash-derived per-room colour from `getRoomAccentColor()`) coloured room names in four components. Removed `getRoomAccentColor()` from media.ts (dead code), removed inline `style={{ "--room-accent": ... }}` props from Entry.tsx, QuickSwitcher.tsx, SpaceView.tsx (2 sites), RoomViewHeader.tsx; replaced all `color-mix(in oklab, var(--room-accent) 70%, ...)` with `color: #ffffff` in RoomList.css, RoomViewHeader.css, QuickSwitcher.css, SpaceView.css (2 occurrences); removed the `uniform_room_list_color` preference (both states rendered identically with one name colour). Deliberately KEPT: `room_list_color` preference (single sidebar accent, kind glyphs only; now the only coloured element in the list). (2) **Recent added as fourth space-rail sub-filter** — the per-section sort feature built earlier (mode tag, cycle-on-click, localStorage) was deleted entirely. In its place, Recent became a sub-filter in the space rail (alongside All chats / Rooms / Direct messages). It narrows NOTHING (include() returns true for all rooms); it is purely a layout/ordering signal. `sections` useMemo short-circuits: when `activeSubFilter === "recent"` returns one unsectioned section of `roomList.toReversed()` with NO Unread section (deliberately: lifting badged rooms would push the just-left conversation back down). `activeSubFilter` moved earlier in component (above sections useMemo) to avoid TDZ error. (3) **Room name size bumped 1rem → 1.125rem** in RoomList.css after mixed-case switch (caps gave every name one volume; mixed case allows emphasis, and user wanted slightly bigger). (4) **Section headers reverted** — the multi-button div structure (section-toggle / section-mode / section-chevron-button) was ONLY needed for the sort tag to be independently clickable. With the sort feature deleted, the tag is gone, so headers reverted to a single `<button>` with simple hover/focus styles.

**Decisions Made**:
- Per-room colours removed entirely; room names white (dark mode only)
- `room_list_color` (single glyph accent) deliberately retained as only remaining accent
- Recent is a rail sub-filter (narrows nothing, no sections, newest-first, no Unread section)
- Section headers single button again (sort tag gone, so complexity unneeded)
- Room name size: 1.125rem (mid-session user request after mixed-case switch)

**Actions Taken**:
- `web/src/api/media.ts`: removed `getRoomAccentColor()` function
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/Entry.tsx`: removed inline `style={{ "--room-accent": ... }}` prop and `getRoomAccentColor` import
- `web/src/ui/QuickSwitcher.tsx`: removed inline `--room-accent` prop and import
- `web/src/ui/roomview/SpaceView.tsx`: removed `--room-accent` props (2 sites) and import
- `web/src/ui/roomview/RoomViewHeader.tsx`: removed `--room-accent` inline style and import
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.css`: replaced `color-mix(in oklab, var(--room-accent) 70%, ...)` with `color: #ffffff`; removed resting-row neutralising rule, `.active` override, conditional fork; room-name colour now one unconditional rule under dark mode; kind-icon rule unconditional; font-size 1rem → 1.125rem
- `web/src/ui/roomview/RoomViewHeader.css`: replaced color-mix with `color: #ffffff`
- `web/src/ui/QuickSwitcher.css`: same color replacement
- `web/src/ui/roomview/SpaceView.css`: same replacement (2 occurrences)
- `web/src/api/types/preferences/preferences.ts`: removed `uniform_room_list_color` preference
- `web/src/ui/StylePreferences.tsx`: removed `data-uniform-room-list-color` attribute effect
- `web/src/api/statestore/space.ts`: `SpaceSubFilterID` → `"rooms" | "dms" | "recent"`; `include()` returns true for "recent"
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.tsx`: `activeSubFilter` moved earlier (above sections useMemo); useMemo short-circuits to single unsectioned section when `activeSubFilter === "recent"`; no Unread section in recent view; section header reverted to single button
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.css`: section header reverted to `button.room-list-section-header` with hover/focus; deleted `.section-mode` block

**Context/Thoughts**:
- User's two asks ("white room names" + "eliminate per-room colours") were the same feature — one visual system.
- Only `room_list_color` (kind glyphs) remains; user flagged purple as "sticking out" on 2026-09-04 (becomes decision point if unstated is preferred).
- Recent view as rail sub-filter (not sort menu) sidesteps interaction disagreement: filter chip and view mode are now one.
- Sort feature (localStorage + cycle-on-click + per-section tags) deleted entirely; user never saw it ship (built 15:15, rejected as undiscoverable, replaced by Recent rail approach).
- Section headers: div-with-three-buttons existed only for sort tag; with tag gone, reverted to simple single button.
- TDZ error caught: `activeSubFilter` must be declared above sections useMemo since the memo reads it.
- Room name size bump (1rem → 1.125rem) modest; user's mixed-case names needed visual support.
- All work uncommitted, ready for dev app verification before commit.

## 2026-09-17 15:15

**Session Summary**: UI/UX refinement session (2026-09-17) with `tauri dev` running live (HMR). All work UNCOMMITTED; zero tsc/eslint errors maintained. Completed five major changes: (1) **macOS title bar unified** — removed separate `div.app-titlebar` band, space rail reserves `--traffic-light-strip` 2rem + .5rem breathing room, all other panes run to top edge, reclaiming 108px, "echo" wordmark now menu bar/Dock only; (2) **space rail always-in-a-space fix** — opened room defaults to all-chats when `space === null` via nullish coalescing, lit tile and expanded band now agree; (3) **per-section room-list sort with localStorage** — new `readSectionSorts()` validates each section ("recent" or "name"), applied in sections useMemo, unread section excluded (live queue), STRUCTURAL CHANGE: `button.room-list-section-header` → `div` with nested `button` children (toggle, optional mode tag, chevron), hover `:has(:focus-visible)`, USER REJECTED cycle-on-click (undiscoverable), replacing with menu next; (4) **unread/mention colour ramp** — blue (hue + badge) for message/notified, red+@ for highlight, survives reduced motion + colour blindness (previous pulse-based was undetectable under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`), badge tier message collapses to .4375rem dot; (5) **Typography: Inter everywhere** — Space Grotesk entirely removed, one typeface, `--display-font-stack` token preserved (role survives), room names mixed case (not uppercase). Designs settled in 5 comparison artifacts; filter chips + view-switch design approved (building next). Published: Title Bar Tryouts, Where the DM Lands, One Chip Row, Quieting the List, Typeface and Tone. Cotypist (macOS text prediction) investigated — already documented in questions.md this session.

**Decisions Made**:
- Title bar: unified top region, no separate band, space rail reserves traffic-light room + .5rem breathing
- Space rail: always in a space; default to all-chats when room is null
- Room-list sort: per-section localStorage preference (recent/name), unread section unaffected
- Section headers: `div` with nested `button` children (toggle, optional mode tag, chevron), hover `:has(:focus-visible)`
- Unread ramp: blue + badge (message/notified) vs red+@ (highlight), hue + shape not motion
- Typography: Inter only, Space Grotesk removed, room names mixed case
- Next: resolve rail-sub-filter overlap question before building filter chips

**Actions Taken**:
- index.css: `--titlebar-height` removed, `--titlebar-background` removed, `--traffic-light-strip: 2rem` added, `--floating-panel-background` token created, `--display-font-stack` to Inter only
- MainScreen.css: removed `div.app-titlebar` block, removed `main.matrix-main { top: ... }` offset, added space-bar padding-top with traffic-light-strip
- MainScreen.tsx: removed `.app-titlebar` div and "echo" wordmark span
- RoomList.tsx: `div.space-bar` gained `data-tauri-drag-region`; openIndex fixed to `partables.indexOf(space?.id ?? allChatsSpace.id)`; new localStorage `echo.room_list_sort` key; readSectionSorts() validation; applied in sections useMemo; unread section sort: null
- RoomList.css: `button.room-list-section-header` → `div` with button children; hover `:has(:focus-visible)`; unread badge changes (dot, count, @); tokens updated (blue unread, red highlight)
- index.html: Space Grotesk removed from Google Fonts request
- RoomList.css room-name: removed `text-transform: uppercase`, adjusted letter-spacing and font-size

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Artifact pattern proved effective: five comparison pages with real CSS deltas let user pick from visual rendering; One Chip Row especially effective (fully vetted before implementation).
- Title bar change cascaded: removing band triggered lit-tile/band-disagreement bug (always-in-a-space logic needed). Fixed both simultaneously.
- Unread ramp reversal required epistemic reset: August red-only relied on pulse (invisible at decision time), machine's Reduce Motion ON made gap obvious. Correction: hue + shape allow accessibility preference to NOT disable distinction.
- Sort menu beats cycle-on-click (three options visible vs cycling blind). Creates Grouped-view-only constraint (Recent has no sections). One Chip Row accommodates this.
- Rail-sub-filter overlap (filter chips vs rail sub-filters): two controls must not disagree. Resolution needed before filter chips built.
- Cotypist findings: 0 windows from AX API is NOT echo-specific (yaak Tauri app identical signature). Tauri/WRY-wide behaviour. Next: Accessibility Inspector to check textarea in AX tree.
- Session ended all work uncommitted, zero tsc/eslint errors maintained.

## 2026-09-14 11:26

**Session Summary**: Timeline quieting session (2026-09-11 through 2026-09-14) responding to user feedback on 0.5.0 after one week in production. User verdict: the ring + rail + plate sender treatment is "too busy"; room-list redesign from 0.5.0 is kept. Built three comparison artifacts using real CSS mock-ups (same-UI-N-variants pattern): "Sender Treatment Tryouts" https://claude.ai/code/artifact/26fcf430-2af7-42f9-aac2-d8f5541c1121, "Ink Name Iterations" https://claude.ai/code/artifact/871721a1-958e-4189-a0d6-9b86a3255a8c, "Colour Name Iterations" https://claude.ai/code/artifact/47f0cda8-1d91-47a5-b886-426ddeb8d63d (user selected G1: larger names 1.0625rem without ring). Implemented commit d8fc2245 "timeline: drop sender rail, ring and plate; larger names; neutral quote spine" (removed rail/ring/plate, enlarged sender names, returned avatar gutter to 1rem, made reply-quote spine static neutral). **echo 0.5.1 released 2026-09-13** via `scripts/release.sh patch` (both notarizations Accepted, DMG stapled, feed verified serving 0.5.1 with notes "A quieter timeline"); main at f66b4f22. **Incident:** pnpm exec in web/ triggered full install, generated pnpm-lock.yaml, broke later commands, eslint errors appeared; fixed by deleting generated files and running npm ci. **Bug found:** custom properties declared on wrong ancestor in mock-ups (names went grey, rings vanished); fixed by declaring where variable is set. **Technique:** headless Chrome one-look render for artifact HTML (`--headless=new --virtual-time-budget=4000 file://`); use HTML entities for dashes (file:// has no charset). **New request:** room-list sort options (built artifact with 6 variants, Claude recommends E, user hasn't picked). All work uncommitted; ready for next session.

**Decisions Made**:
- Sender rail removed permanently: busy, doubled up with reply-quote spine.
- Avatar ring and name plate removed: part of "busy" verdict.
- Sender names: room-aware colour, full opacity, 1.0625rem/600 — user wants MORE prominence.
- Reply-quote spine: static neutral, never per-sender colour.
- Avatar gutter back to 1rem (was 1.5rem for ring accommodation).
- Release 0.5.1 as patch (squashed timeline quieting into one commit).
- In web/ use npm/./node_modules/.bin/ until pnpm migration decided (global rule conflicts with repo).

**Actions Taken**:
- TimelineEvent.tsx: removed avatar ring box-shadow, removed rail ::before pseudo, removed name plate, removed inner span.event-sender-text.
- TimelineEvent.css: removed all rail rules, second suppression block.
- ReplyBody.css: default `--reply-border-color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--secondary-text-color) 55%, transparent)`, deleted 11 `.sender-color-N` blockquote rules.
- ReplyBody.tsx: removed inline colour calculation, removed sender-color-null class, dropped getRoomAccentColor import.
- index.css: `--timeline-avatar-gap` 1.5rem → 1rem, glow bar 2rem → 1.5rem.
- Release 0.5.1 shipped with commit d8fc2245 + release.sh patch (nohup detached, no port conflicts).
- Built "Room List Sort Options" artifact https://claude.ai/code/artifact/c4f45c74-1d10-4f4c-8616-9c33e37e7cb4 (A–F variants, E recommended).
- Fixed pnpm incident: deleted web/pnpm-lock.yaml and web/pnpm-workspace.yaml, ran npm ci in web/ (dev stopped).
- Updated constraints.md with 2026-09-13 entries; marked prior timeline geometry constraint as SUPERSEDED.

**Context/Thoughts**:
- User's room-list redesign from 0.5.0 (Unread section, colour system, entry styling) is kept; only the timeline sender treatment (ring/rail/plate) was "too busy."
- Knock-on: collapsed thread messages lost their thread-accent spine (shares the border property). Not yet asked for restoration; marked as open question.
- Quote text inside reply blocks still uses the quoted sender's colour (name + small avatar); spine is now static neutral.
- Room-list sort options (artifact with 6 variants) addresses user's buried-DM problem ("struggling to see DMs that maybe aren't unread, but that I'd like to revisit"). **User has NOT picked yet** — Claude recommends E (per-section sort + mode tag on header); C is smallest change; F is optional add-on.
- Pnpm incident: implementer acted correctly per global rule, but this repo hasn't migrated from npm. Global rule now actively conflicts; pnpm migration decision is urgent-ish.
- Release 0.5.1: dev stopped before release.sh (no port conflicts); wall time ~30 min; main at f66b4f22 (Release v0.5.1) on top of d8fc2245.
- Headless Chrome (`--headless=new --virtual-time-budget=4000 file://`) exits on its own (not deprecated headless mode); renders artifact HTML fine for visual one-look check.
- Verified facts for next session: reply-quote spine decoupling allows future per-section styling if desired; thread-message spine restoration would need a separate variable/rule.
- Session ended with all work uncommitted (ready for next session: sort-option implementation, prod app verification, or other next actions).

## 2026-09-04 18:00

**Session Summary**: Design-and-implement session ending with **echo 0.5.0 released 2026-09-04**. Main work: reaction chip toggle (clicking a chip you reacted with redacts your reaction; no local echo of counts, only sync echo or 20s fallback), room-aware sender colour allocation (new sendercolor.ts module with greedy palette allocation per room, localStorage persisted, never reshuffled), Unread section (new preference-gated drawer above Rooms/DMs, collapsible, active room pinned), room-list colour system redesign (uniform override now works correctly with nested specificity fix, room-list names are ink under uniform mode), timeline sender treatment (ring + rail + plate: double avatar ring via box-shadow, 1.5px sender rail in --sender-color, name on faint plate background, all keyed to room-aware colours), timeline geometry (avatar gap widened 1rem → 1.5rem to fit ring + rail + text), glow bar height raised 1.5rem → 2rem. Release shipped 2026-09-04 via release.sh (launched detached with tauri dev stopped, no port conflicts), GitHub release with embedded notes, feed verified serving 0.5.0. Main now at 8502b9f3. Dev app stopped for release. _(Checkpoint written 2026-09-08)_

**Decisions Made**:
- Reaction toggle: click a chip you reacted with to redact (no un-react path existed before)
- Room-aware sender colours: palette allocation per room, greedy heuristic (farthest hue from nearest taken), never reshuffled
- Resting rows reversed: removed the V4 dim (initial design), now no dimming on resting rows; emphasis on wash + bars + badge only
- Uniform room-list colour: ink names + white active name, fix applied by nesting override inside resting rule for specificity (0,6,5)
- Timeline sender treatment: ring + rail + plate + room-aware colours (user confirmed "R1 + ring" from mock-ups)
- Timeline avatar gap: 1.5rem to fit 4px ring bleed + 1.5px rail + text
- Release 0.5.0 as minor bump with reaction toggle + colour system + Unread section

**Actions Taken**:
- `web/src/api/sendercolor.ts`: new module `createSenderColorAllocator` (injectable deps, greedy nearest-hue allocation, localStorage `echo.room_sender_colors`)
- `web/src/api/media.ts`: `getSenderColor(roomID, userID)` wrapper routing to allocator, colour returned as `--sender-color` inline on `div.timeline-event`
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.tsx`: Unread section (isUnread helper, unreadPin ref, collapsible with id "unread"), Entry.tsx passes room_id to getPreviewText and colours sender-name span inline
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.css`: `--room-list-name-color` token (ink #c9c2cc), override nested inside resting rule for specificity (0,6,5), white override on `.active span.event-sender`
- `web/src/ui/timeline/TimelineEvent.tsx`: double avatar ring (outer 2px --background-color, inner 2px --sender-color), 1.5px rail via `::before`, sender name on plate (background: currentColor 14% mix), `--sender-color` inline
- `web/src/index.css`: `--timeline-avatar-gap` 1rem → 1.5rem, glow bar 1.5rem → 2rem
- `web/src/ui/modal/ReactionPill.tsx`: click chip-you-reacted-with to toggle reaction off (optimistic dim, sync echo or 20s fallback)
- Mock-up artifacts: five comparison pages (resting rows, type specs, recipe, palette, chat pane variants) hydrated from actual CSS values
- Learnings: extended css-layering-and-stacking.md (nested & specificity, room-list uniform override history), extended dev-environment-gotchas.md (Vite IPv6, WKWebView localStorage, prod logs, media 502, nohup-detached, subagent cleanup)
- scripts/release.sh: launched detached (`nohup … &`) with tauri dev stopped first (release runs 25–35 min, harness cap 10 min)
- GitHub release: 0.5.0 published with embedded notes; updater feed verified serving version

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Reaction socket: no local echo of counts (backend aggregates to bare counts, discards senders). Chips dim optimistically while send/redact in flight, settle on sync echo or timeout. Backend never recomputes counts for pending local reaction (counts update only on sync echo); redactions trigger recount via processRedaction (sync.go).
- Sender palette: ten dark colours, four warms within 48°, gaps: no true green/blue/magenta. Worst contrast is coral at 6.0:1 (5.0:1 @ .9 opacity), not grape as old comment claimed. Same-room palette avoids repeats in >10-sender case (least-used slot + hash tiebreak).
- Room-list uniform fix: old 38% accent mix at (0,5,4) beat override at (0,4,4); CSS nesting copies override into resting rule at (0,6,5) so it now wins. Dark-only by design, matching original.
- Timeline geometry: rail excluded on small/hidden/membership/small-thread/edit-history/pinned/notification/confirm-modal events. Plate works without clipping because `overflow: hidden` / `contain: strict` removed from timeline entries (prior paint-deferral bug fixed in 0.4.1).
- Unread section: new `unread_section` preference (appearance, anyGlobalContext, default true), module-level `isUnread` predicate (same as mark-all-read gate), active room pinned via `unreadPin` ref so it doesn't vanish under cursor, collapsible with id "unread", works in sub-filtered views.
- Production build: app and DMG both notarized and accepted. Dev build profile `dev.tbird.echo-dev` got fresh WebKit storage (lost custom user colours #ad9cfe, now {}; another profile still has #e06b75 and @zach #7aacf4). Cause unknown (user may have removed it or it was dev-only).
- Artifacts pattern: proved successful for visual decisions. Five comparison pages let user pick from side-by-side rendering of real UI with exact CSS deltas per card. Generators are session-scoped tmp (die at end); recipe is durable.
- Vite IPv6 gotcha: IPv4-only readiness probe (127.0.0.1:6173) fails even when server running on [::1]:6173. Affected any harness waiting for Vite readiness.
- Subagent cleanup: two instances killed tauri dev (one via stray TaskStop, one via headless-Chrome cleanup). Process was launched as direct harness child. Fix: briefs now forbid launching browsers, starting bg tasks, calling TaskStop. nohup-detached processes survive.
- Prod logs carry debug lines (grep "send/m.room.encrypted" finds sends; none found morning of 2026-09-02 during outage, confirming reactions never reached backend). Media 502 signature: "Failed to copy media to temporary file" (homeserver down, not app).
- Open questions: (1) Purple glyph beside ink room names "sticks out" — user deferred; (2) home-view request unclear; (3) should failed timeline images retry; (4) member list/mentions still use per-user colours (room-agnostic); (5) uniform-off path still dims resting names (inconsistent with uniform-on); (6) light mode unaddressed; (7) hover-menu React button sends duplicates (400 → alert); (8) timeline timestamps fail AA contrast (2.8:1); (9) palette gaps (no true blue/green/magenta); (10) pnpm migration decision.

## 2026-09-01 19:38

**Session Summary**: Assessment-only session; no source code changed. Evaluated iOS/Android mobile strategies: matrix-rust-sdk inside the Tauri app (superseded: Element X brings the SDK, so no integration into the Tauri app is needed), Element X fork as owned scaffold (chosen: brings matrix-rust-sdk, session/notification/verification infra; app writes new screens to design-language spec), from-scratch SwiftUI (cleaner end state but non-working interim), FluffyChat (loses to Element X when Android dropped). Evaluated hosted gomuks backend + thin frontend (rejected: user prefers native feel, no server). Evaluated WASM backend (iOS suspension kills sync, notifications cannot carry decrypted content). Evaluated Linux/Windows desktop port (moderate plumbing: CGO sqlite3 cross-compile, per-triple binaries, macOS-specific chrome; no decision taken). Decision: iOS-only owned Element X fork, no upstream rebasing, rust-sdk via Swift package, design-language document as cross-platform contract (not shared code), Android out of scope, desktop stays as-is. Findings archived for reuse on ports if later chosen.

**Decisions Made**:
- iOS app = owned Element X fork (iOS-only, no Android, no upstream rebasing, rust-sdk via Swift package)
- Consistency via design-language document (tokens, colors, look/feel), not shared code; mobile UI bespoke to mobile
- Desktop + iOS = two codebases, one design language; phone is separate Matrix device with own keys/DB
- Keep Element X's session/notification/verification/key-backup/rust-sdk plumbing as-is; write new room list + timeline screens against design doc; token-restyle remaining screens
- Linux/Windows port assessed but not decided; findings preserved for future reuse

**Actions Taken**:
- Source survey only (Explore agent); architecture analysis and decision framework
- Verified backend auth mechanics (no rate limiting, tokens HMAC-SHA256 7-day, token_key = master secret)
- Documented alternatives with rationale (why each path rejected, reusable findings)
- No file edits outside .claude/

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Element X is the only viable iOS scaffold once Android is out (FluffyChat would be picked if Android mattered; Cinny web-only)
- Owned fork discipline: no upstream rebases, only matrix-rust-sdk updates via Swift package; app owns the UI divergence
- Design-language document becomes source of truth for both codebases (enables consistency without code sharing)
- Linux/Windows assessment findings (CGO needs per-triple runners or cross-toolchain, Assets.car macOS-only, latent Windows data-dir bug, window chrome CSS macOS-scoped, release.sh single-platform end-to-end) useful if those ports are revisited
- Hosted backend security if ever revisited: backend has NO rate limiting, holds all E2EE keys, Tailscale recommended over public exposure

## 2026-09-01 14:44

**Session Summary**: Four releases shipped (0.4.0–0.4.3) over five days (2026-08-28 through 2026-09-01), all verified working end-to-end. **0.4.0 (minor):** settings page fully rebuilt — category rail with room/device toggle, full-width autofocused search, simple rows showing effective value + "applies to" line, per-setting chevron expands scope editors, deleted the old 5-column matrix. Palette tempered — all warm tints now derive from single `--warm-tint-rgb` token (`#f0e2d8` Tempered vs `#fecdb2` original Ferra), mauve surfaces (`#4a4553`) neutralized. Unread tiers: red glow bar (rail) + red badge + row wash, all three tiers collapsed to one red deliberately; mention-tier pulses gated on Ignore Reduce Motion preference. Release-notes feature (RELEASE_NOTES.md read by scripts/release.sh preflight → embedded in latest.json as `notes` → rendered in-app by typed strict parser (http(s)-only links, never HTML pass-through); update chip clickable → notes modal, notes stashed to localStorage at download, claimed once on first launch of matching version). Fixed: SSO session cookie Secure flag hardcoded `true` in pkg/gomuks/sso.go (first Go divergence from upstream; SSO failed on plain-HTTP origins with "no session cookie"). Dev builds seed backend auth cookie at path /_gomuks/auth (RFC 6265 path ordering beats stale HttpOnly cookies). **0.4.1 & 0.4.2 (patches):** reaction click fix (read emoji from DOM attr vs currentTarget.title which no longer exists); unread badge one size (removed size distinction). Membership events no longer drive unread counts (pkg/hicli/pushrules.go divergence) — user's old-Synapse `.m.rule.member_event` had notify action (37 events lit the whole list); fix: evaluatePushRules skips Notify/Highlight/Sound for m.room.member unless isInviteForMe (fails closed). **0.4.3 (patch):** the parted rail — clicking a partable tile (All chats / Outside spaces / real space) slides dark rail apart revealing lighter under-layer band with tile + engraved divider + three sub-filters (All chats / Rooms / DMs). Statestore: `AllChatsSpace` (id fi.mau.gomuks.all_chats, include() → true, registered in pseudoSpaces; boot default null — interchangeable with all-chats view); `SubFilteredSpace` wraps RoomListFilter, ANDs DM predicate, delegates id to parent (space lookup sees space, not sub-filter); `SpaceOrphansSpace.include` dropped DM exclusion. DMs sub-filter under All chats replaces old direct-chats view. Bell moved below spaces. Rail sized +25% (tiles 3.125rem, glyphs 1.75rem, sub-filter rows matching tiles). Glow pill follows ACTIVE VIEW: selected sub-filter carries it (x computed to align with rail pills). Animation: band height 0fr↔1fr, open .26s / close .52s (close = half open speed) on cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1) (house curve); contents cross-fade front-loaded; unmount via animationend + 750ms fallback; reduce-motion users skip closing state in JS + CSS animation:none gates. Closing band renders ONLY drawer (divider+sub-filters); departing space handed to dark segment at identical pixel position (fixed bug where space faded with drawer). Active room row: warm wash rgba(--warm-tint-rgb,.24) + lit edge + dark seam (compound selector `&.active, &:not(.hidden) ~ &.active` for specificity). Room-list colour preference: `room_list_color` string pref + colour swatch editor, `uniform_room_list_color` default flipped true. Mark-all-read button in room-list header (shown only unreads exist, ConfirmModal, receipt at each room). README tagline simplified.

**Decisions Made**:
- All unread tiers red deliberately (Ferra gradient rejected; restorable via tokens).
- Close animation = half open speed (52ms close vs 26ms open) on house curve (accelerate-out close would slam).
- Closing band excludes its departing tile (tile handed to dark segment at pixel position before fade starts).
- AllChatsSpace null duality (null == all-chats view in history/active-checks; object keys drawer).
- Glow pill follows active view exactly (one visible; space tile relinquishes it while parted).
- Uniform room-list colour default enabled (was off; now opt-out instead of opt-in).
- README tagline plain (stop selling the app to itself).
- Release-notes parser: no HTML pass-through, typed nodes only, http(s)-links restricted.

**Actions Taken**:
- Settings rebuild: SettingsView.tsx full rewrite (category rail, search box, scope editors per-setting, no matrix), ColorPreferenceCell component, room_list_color / uniform_room_list_color prefs.
- Palette: web/src/index.css `--warm-tint-rgb` variable (240 226 216 Tempered); surfaces derived via color-mix.
- Unread treatment: rail glow bar, badge, row wash all keyed to single red tokens; mention pulse via preference gate.
- Release-notes: scripts/release.sh reads RELEASE_NOTES.md preflight; web/src/util/releasenotes.ts typed parser (headings/bullets/bold/code/links); store claims once per version; modal shows on update.
- SSO cookie: pkg/gomuks/sso.go Secure: false conditional (dev only via insecure_cookies flag, already in place).
- Auth cookie seeding: lib.rs writes to /_gomuks/auth path at launch.
- Membership events: pkg/hicli/pushrules.go evaluatePushRules gate on isInviteForMe.
- Parted rail: AllChatsSpace / SubFilteredSpace / SpaceOrphansSpace (include logic); DM predicate AND applied; sub-filter rows same height as space tiles.
- Rail animation: 0fr↔1fr grid-template-rows, min-height:0 on inner flex, cross-fade on contents, animationend + 750ms unmount fallback, JS state machine skips closing for reduce-motion.
- Active-room styling: compound selector for hairline specificity, warm wash + edges.
- Playwright-WebKit harness: token recipe (username+token_key → compact JSON → b64url HMAC-SHA256), railwatch2/allchats/activerow scripts, verified 18/18 transitions + 40 rooms + 18 DMs partition.
- Bugs found by harness: closing band tile inside band (fixed by tile handoff), active-row edges beaten by sibling ~& specificity (compound selector fix).

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Read-receipt bug state: gate (scrolledToBottom && focused && newest event) in TimelineView ~75-97; prime suspect util/focus.ts seeds focused from document.hasFocus() at module load, never updates in WKWebView on native activation. Diagnostic plan: re-add [read-gate] console.debug logging the gate fields; expect focused:false / documentHasFocus:true. Needs real WKWebView (dev app + devtools) or Playwright harness refinement.
- Stale membership rows: 37 unread_type=2 rows in DB still unread after 0.4.2 fix; user hasn't asked to clean them; offer stands when they want it (app must quit, cleanup runs, restart).
- RELEASE_NOTES statelessness trap caught red: script CAN rerun with same notes; file ships verbatim; must rewrite BEFORE release.sh or previous release ships again. Guard comparing against release-notes/<prev>.md recommended.
- bundle_dmg.sh stale-volume failure: when /Volumes/echo exists from prior DMG install, bundle fails to create volume with same name. Fix: `hdiutil detach /Volumes/echo && scripts/release.sh` (version-restore trap works).
- Playwright harness location: /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-tbird-gomuks/.../scratchpad (session-scoped tmp, dies at session end; recipe durable in learnings).
- All four releases shipped successfully, all verified live, no rollbacks needed.

## 2026-08-27 16:52

**Session Summary**: Completed the full release pipeline with eight releases published (0.2.0 through 0.3.7), all verified working in production. Fixed four latent bugs in release.sh that were diagnosed by actually running it to completion (wrong signing env var name, Cargo.lock not bumped as a fourth version file, DMG missing its own notarization round-trip, gh account drift during build). Fixed the backend auth fresh-install trap where a config-less machine would see a stdin prompt that fails with EOF in a sidecar. Isolated sidecar storage via GOMUKS_*_HOME environment variables and debug `-dev` profile so tauri dev never touches installed-app data. Fixed external-link opening in production (three root-cause misdiagnoses before finding the tauri-plugin-shell competing body listener in the bubble phase; fixed via capture-phase + stopPropagation). Discovered and documented the Tauri ACL remote-origin rule (http://localhost:29325 = remote, all app commands denied unless in capability). Migrated data from old gomuks directories to dev.tbird.echo with fallback-on-failure, renamed localStorage keys seabug→echo (acceptable loss because bundle ID change had already reset WebKit). Changed bundle ID from com.tbird.echo to dev.tbird.echo to match naming convention. Published README with logo, badges, install instructions, data locations, and AGPL credit. Regenerated icon set after fixing the icon mask (white margin was being baked by qlmanage). Fixed three icon-mask-related display issues. Enabled 30-minute auto-update checks (was only at launch). Verified all: signed+notarized DMG, fresh install on machine that never saw gomuks, auto-update download+signature verification, Restart button, no login prompt beyond Matrix account, encrypted message decryption and key backup in production, URL previews work, external links open system browser, light-mode titlebar. All 8 releases tested end-to-end by user. Clean working tree, main in sync with origin.

**Decisions Made**:
- Bundle ID dev.tbird.echo to match debug-build naming convention (-dev suffix).
- Sidecar data isolation via env vars, no Go code changes (stays zero-divergence from upstream).
- Fallback-on-rename for data migration (postpone corruption risk over potential lost state).
- WebKit store not migrated (acceptable one-time re-login; corrupting it is worse).
- Backend password random + discarded (nothing can log in, nothing needs to).
- App auth via minted session token in webview init script (no browser session needed).
- External links fixed via capture-phase, not shell-plugin changes (shell plugin is mandatory for sidecar).
- Auto-update checks every 30min (vs. launch-only), skip while download staged.
- Tauri ACL: all app commands ACL-checked on remote origins, requires build.rs + capability entries.
- opener: split permission (command + URL scope); both required.
- Release.sh preflight signing test before expensive builds.
- release.sh exports GH_TOKEN to pin both git push and gh release create.
- Git blob-strip via filter-branch on unpushed commits only (preserves upstream fork relationship).

**Actions Taken**:
- web/src-tauri/src/lib.rs: ensure_backend_config generates random password, passes GOMUKS_*_HOME env vars, -dev profile for debug builds.
- web/src/util/updater.ts: 30-minute recurring check (not just launch), skip while download staged, finally-block flag reset.
- web/src-tauri/build.rs: AppManifest declares restart_for_update and fetch_og_tags commands.
- web/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json: grant both generated allow-* identifiers, remote.urls block for localhost:29325, opener:allow-default-urls.
- web/src/ui/externallinks.ts: capture-phase handler with stopPropagation, spoiler-override guard.
- web/src/ui/TextMessageBody.tsx: spoiler guard on external-link clicks (prevent opening hidden links).
- web/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json: identifier → dev.tbird.echo.
- web/src/ui/settings/SettingsView.tsx: localStorage key rename seabug→echo.
- scripts/release.sh: signing preflight, Cargo.lock in version-bump routine, DMG notarization, GH_TOKEN export.
- design/: icon mask regenerated (rounded rect inset 100, radius 185 applied as alpha channel).
- web/src-tauri/src/lib.rs: data migration with fs::rename + fallback, skips WebKit store.
- web/README.md: new, targeted at first-time installers (DMG install, data locations, AGPL credit, logo with HTTP 200 verification).
- .gitignore: added binaries/*, icons/Assets.car, .DS_Store.
- git filter-branch: rewritten c1529c6c..HEAD (4 commits, 55MB binary stripped twice), backup tag pre-blob-strip, verified zero tree-diff.

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Three issues were "resolved" in questions.md in prior sessions but were actually still broken: external links (marked 2026-08-25 but wrong root cause), fetch_og_tags (same), restart button. All three ended up being the same root cause (tauri ACL remote-origin denial). Release-only bugs need release-environment testing because prod builds have no logging and no devtools.
- The tauri-plugin-shell competing listener was invisible to search; only live inspection of the init script source revealed it. This is a pattern worth remembering: plugin side effects that are "magical" at runtime may be undocumented and need source-code archaeology.
- The backend password generation could have been `random(32) → argon2` but bcrypt was simpler and sufficient (auth is process-internal anyway, nowhere this password is transmitted).
- Capture-phase for external links is a solved pattern now; if external links ever break again, check for competing listeners (shell or otherwise) in the bubble phase.
- External-link capture in bubble phase would have worked if the shell listener weren't injected, but the plugin is mandatory (no way to disable the script), so capture is the only fix.
- Release identity pinning via GH_TOKEN is a win for reproducibility and safety; the old pattern of "whatever account is logged in" has too many drift vectors.
- All eight releases (0.2.0–0.3.7) shipped successfully, verified working, no production rollbacks needed.

## 2026-08-27 08:50

**Session Summary**: Completed the release pipeline (auto-update via tauri-plugin-updater 2.10.1, signed/notarized DMG, GitHub Releases with tauri's latest.json updater config, minisign keypair for artifact signatures) and diagnosed+fixed icon build pipeline. Root-caused two failed release runs to a wedged ibtoold daemon (not .icon content as earlier diagnosed), then fixed by pre-compiling icons/Assets.car with tauri-bundler accepting .car files as-is (tauri-cli 2.11.4 confirmed in source). scripts/release.sh now handles version bumping (3 version files), npm+go builds in strict order, signing/notarization from keychain (app-specific password "echo-notary", minisign key "echo-updater-key"), stapling verification, latest.json generation, and GitHub release creation — with version-restore trap on failure (tested twice). Permissions allowlisted to avoid constant prompts. All implementation verified: goolm sidecar decrypted live sessions, updater capability wired, GitHub endpoint live. Everything ready for 0.2.0 release except the release.sh run itself. Session ran on Fable with too-high token cost for implementation detail — finish in fresh session on Opus.

**Decisions Made**:
- Pre-compile icons/Assets.car in release.sh, not at bundle time — tauri-bundler will accept .car as-is and skip actool entirely. Avoids ibtoold flakiness.
- Assets.car pre-compile retry loop with killall ibtoold between attempts — deterministic, handles transient wedge state.
- Updater endpoint on GitHub Releases (`https://github.com/taylorbird/gomuks/releases/latest/download/latest.json`) — no custom server needed; GitHub CDN handles distribution.
- Minisign keypair for artifact signatures (minisign public key in tauri.conf.json, private key at ~/.tauri/echo.key password-protected in keychain) — standard Tauri updater pattern.
- Credentials in system keychain (notary app-specific password, minisign key password, Developer ID cert) — zero hardcoded secrets.

**Actions Taken**:
- web/package.json: added @tauri-apps/plugin-updater 2.10.1, updated package-lock.json.
- web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml: added tauri-plugin-updater 2.10.1.
- web/src/util/updater.ts: new utility, auto-checks for updates on app launch (isTauri && PROD), polls every 60s if update available but not downloaded, calls downloadAndInstall() and shows "Update ready — Restart" chip.
- web/src/ui/MainScreen.tsx: integrated updater chip next to syncLoader in header.
- web/src/util/appversion.ts: new utility, reads app version from Tauri config at build time.
- web/src/ui/settings/SettingsView.tsx: displays app version in settings masthead.
- web/src-tauri/src/lib.rs: added `restart_for_update` Tauri command, kills sidecar before app.restart() (critical: orphaned old sidecar on port 29325 would serve OLD embedded frontend after update).
- web/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json: added `updater:default` remote-origin capability (mandatory for prod IPC).
- web/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json: added `updater` object (endpoint, pubkey, active:true); added `createUpdaterArtifacts: true` to bundle config.
- scripts/release.sh: complete rewrite. Bumps version in 3 files (tauri.conf.json, web/package.json, web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml) with patch/minor/auto semantics. Builds: npm run build → go build -tags goolm → npx tauri build (signing via APPLE_DEVELOPER_IDENTITY env var, notarization via APPLE_TEAM_ID + notary app password fetched from keychain). Pre-compiles icons/Assets.car with 5-attempt retry loop (killall ibtoold between attempts). Verifies stapling. Generates latest.json. Commits version files only, tags, pushes branch+tag, creates GitHub release with DMG + echo.app.tar.gz + .sig files + latest.json. Version-restore trap on any failure.
- ~/.claude/settings.json: allowlisted Bash(/Users/tbird/gomuks/scripts/release.sh:*), Bash(killall ibtoold:*), Bash(xcrun actool:*), Bash(rm -r /private/tmp/claude-501:*) to avoid permission prompts during release.
- Verified: goolm tag in Go build, sidecar decrypts olm/megolm in live session, key backups upload, updater handshake succeeds, `restart_for_update` called (sidecar killed before app restart).

**Context/Thoughts**:
- actool wedge is a persistent daemon state issue (ibtoold), not .icon file content — corrects 2026-08-25 diagnosis. Identical commands fail then succeed after killall. Pre-compile path avoids the issue entirely.
- Token cost this session was high because implementation details (Rust, shell scripting, keychain) ran inline on Fable. Remaining steps are mechanical (commit, run release.sh, test, verify). Plan: commit staged files now, finish release in fresh Opus session to recoup cost.
- Sidecar MUST be killed in `restart_for_update` before app.restart(), else old gomuks-aarch64-apple-darwin process stays on port 29325 and new app embeds new dist but old frontend loads from old sidecar.
- User should back up ~/.tauri/echo.key — losing it bricks all future updates (minisign keypair is irreplaceable; public key is distributed; private key not kept anywhere else).

## 2026-08-25 23:03

**Session Summary**: Two-day dense session (2026-08-24 and 2026-08-25) completing the visual rebrand and production architecture. On 2026-08-24: replaced Lato with Inter base font + Space Grotesk display font across sidebar names, room headers, space dashboard titles/member names, and timeline sender names via new --display-font-stack token and Google Fonts link; refined timeline sender styling (min-height on sender row, name opacity-dimmed to 75%, all names now label-size .875rem/600/.015em, avatar gap doubled, color-5 yellow→honey-gold for dim contrast). On 2026-08-25: rebranded project from Seabug to echo (identifier com.tbird.echo, bundle ID, window title, masthead, login heading, index.html <title>); locked penguin icon (low-poly faceted side profile, violet/blue facets, sources in design/) and regenerated icon set via tauri icon CLI after bumping @tauri-apps/cli to ^2.11.0 for .icon support — discovered Icon Composer's SVG layer crashes actool deterministically, PNG-layer workaround documented; completely rewired production architecture to load http://localhost:29325 same-origin instead of static dist (root cause: Go server lacks CORS and cookie is SameSite=Lax), implementing TCP readiness wait in lib.rs before window creation and making capabilities/default.json remote.urls entry mandatory (else all prod IPC silently dies); fixed ACL remote-origin denial by adding core:window:allow-start-dragging and remote.urls block, which fixed external link opening; applied UX fixes (room-list width default 350→400px with localStorage key bump, hiddenTitle true→false, drag region attributes on titlebar/room-header/room-name); documented logo-design skill (SVG-first diverge-to-numeric process). All work uncommitted on seabug-visual-redesign; fresh 19:04 build (echo.app + DMG) created and awaiting user verification.

**Decisions Made**:
- Inter + Space Grotesk font stack replaces Lato everywhere — Inter is neutral, Space Grotesk adds personality to hierarchical text (names, titles, usernames); Google Fonts link loads both 400-700 weights.
- Opacity-dim sender names (75%) rather than color-token dims — allows per-user overrides (cheats, custom colors) to dim equally and consistently.
- Rebrand to "echo" (lowercase) with identifier com.tbird.echo — user's branding choice; localStorage keys deliberately NOT renamed (would wipe state, migration shim needed if ever attempted).
- Production same-origin architecture over CORS retrofit — empirically proven cross-origin impossible without Go server changes; user preferred "one package" (sidecar embedded in dist); requires strict npm run build → go build → tauri build order for prod changes.
- Penguin icon locked with design/ folder as single source of truth — SVG exact outline + facets, PNG layer for icon regeneration; Icon Composer .icon package blocked pending user PNG re-export (SVG layer + clipPath crashes actool deterministically).
- TCP readiness wait in lib.rs (500ms connect timeout, 100ms interval, 15s deadline) over random retry — deterministic, fixes old ECONNREFUSED startup race as side effect.
- Capabilities split into local (app URL) vs remote (sidecar origin) requirement — remote.urls entry mandatory or silent IPC failure; core:window:allow-start-dragging explicit grant (not in core:default).
- Room-list width default bump 350→400px with localStorage key rename (old default was persisted, rename forces new value for existing users) — was too narrow for redesigned rows.
- Window drag regions via data-tauri-drag-region bare attribute on titlebar, deep attribute on room-name (Tauri v2 semantics: bare matches element only, deep matches subtree, interactive tags block; text selection on room name suppressed as side effect).

**Actions Taken**:
- Fonts: replaced Lato all sources (RoomList.css, RoomViewHeader.css, SpaceView.css, TimelineEvent.css, index.css) with Inter base + Space Grotesk via --display-font-stack token; added Google Fonts link web/index.html (Inter 400-700, Space Grotesk 400-700); added src-tauri/target to eslint.config.js ignores.
- Timeline sender styling: web/src/ui/timeline/TimelineEvent.css (sender row min-height calc, gap 0, opacity .75, .875rem/600/.015em tracking, avatar gap doubled); web/src/index.css (--sender-color-5 #ffd93d→#f0c674).
- Rebrand: tauri.conf.json (productName→"echo", identifier→"com.tbird.echo"), web/src/ui/settings/SettingsView.tsx (masthead eyebrow), web/src/ui/WebAuthLogin.tsx (heading "echo"), web/index.html (<title>echo), bundle ID usage in code.
- Icon: design/ folder created (echo-penguin-facet.svg + echo-penguin-layer.png 1024 RGBA + README.md); ran npx tauri icon design/echo-penguin-layer.png (regenerated all sizes); @tauri-apps/cli bumped ^2.10.0 → ^2.11.0 (locked 2.11.4); echo.icon copied to web/src-tauri/icons/ from Icon Composer, listed first in bundle.icon (with caveat: SVG layer + clipPath causes actool crash; user must re-export PNG layer).
- Production architecture: web/src-tauri/src/lib.rs (added TCP readiness wait on setup, window creation moved to run_on_main_thread after backend ready, config.url overridden to backend origin in prod, dev cfg!(debug_assertions) unchanged); tauri.conf.json windows[0] (added "create": false); web/src/api/backend.ts (BACKEND_URL/BACKEND_WS_URL/isTauri exports, all 19 _gomuks sites routed through it, gomuksWebWasm guarded with !window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__); capabilities/default.json (added remote.urls entry for http://localhost:29325, added core:window:allow-start-dragging explicit grant).
- UX fixes: web/src/ui/MainScreen.tsx (roomListWidth→roomListWidth2 localStorage key); tauri.conf.json (hiddenTitle true→false); web/src/ui/MainScreen.css + web/src/ui/roomview/RoomViewHeader.css + web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.tsx (drag region attributes added).
- Learnings: .claude/learnings/dev-environment-gotchas.md build-command section corrected (package is ./cmd/gomuks, embed order documented); logo-design skill created (~/.claude/skills/logo-design/SKILL.md, SVG-first process distilled from research).
- Artifacts published: "echo Icon Playbook" (GPT Image/Gemini/Midjourney prompts, macOS 26 icon pipeline, research findings), "echo Logomarks" (18 design rounds).

**Context/Thoughts**:
- actool (Xcode 26.6) crashes with "attempt to insert nil object" when Icon Composer exports a .icon whose ONLY layer is SVG with clipPath — deterministic crash, not edge case. User must re-export with PNG layer. The 18:03 build that seemed to succeed with the SVG .icon is unexplained (possibly actool cache, possibly file not actually included in bundle).
- Sidecar go:embeds web/dist (web/frontend.go) — CRITICAL: any frontend change shipped to prod requires the strict order npm run build → go build ./cmd/gomuks → npx tauri build. Prod-visible frontend mismatch is one missed build step away.
- Remote capability currently grants full permission set including shell:spawn/kill to sidecar origin — security note flagged for tightening before distributing to friends (next-action item).
- fetch_og_tags (URL-preview webview tier) still dead in prod — needs follow-up work (app permission file + capability entry in capabilities/default.json).
- Light-mode titlebar text caveat: --titlebar-background #232125 is unconditional; light-mode native title text will be dark-on-dark (flagged as one-liner fix pending, next-actions item 6).
- Text selection on room header suppressed as side effect of data-tauri-drag-region="deep" on room-name element (Tauri v2 drag-region deep semantics block pointer events; caveat documented).
- User verification of 19:04 build (fresh echo.app + DMG) pending: window drag functional, title bar shows "echo", room-list width properly wide, YouTube link opens.

## 2026-08-21 13:56

**Session Summary**: Extensive visual polish and functional improvements across the Seabug redesign. Applied a Dracula-inspired candy color system to sender names and room identifiers via `getRoomAccentColor(roomID)` in media.ts; implemented full room-list redesign with full-width hover/selected states, hairline separator lines, 4rem content height, off-center glow bar, and conversation-kind glyphs (DM icon, group icon, room icon). Built a space dashboard in SpaceView (5rem avatar masthead with accent name, topic, member/room counts, quick action buttons: Settings/Share/View timeline, expandable sections for Spaces/Rooms/Members, join buttons on non-joined rooms, responsive member grid capped at 30). Added a cheat console easter egg (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+G → D-pad controller UI, Konami code ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA toggles "raam-green" cheat, effect: `getUserColorOverride()` returns green `#50fa7b` for user localpart "raam" case-insensitive). Reorganized settings with category field on all preferences, 15 scope prunes (custom_css marked as per-room removal, flagged), zero-lint/zero-tsc baseline established for the first time. Fixed platform issues: aligned Tauri 2.11 (crate ↔ npm minor lockstep), added WKWebView clipboard fallback (`util/clipboard.ts`), diagnosed startup auth race on shell rebuild (pending frontend retry). Removed `content-visibility: auto` + `useContentVisibility` hook from room-list entries (WebKit paint-defer causing stale active highlight on Alt+arrows), fixed `getMembers()` infinite loop (fresh `[]` in useSyncExternalStore), all work UNCOMMITTED on seabug-visual-redesign branch.

**Decisions Made**:
- Candy colors via hash (room accent via `roomID` hash modulo palette size; sender colors via user ID hash) — replicable, deterministic, matches per-user color pref system already in place.
- Room glow bar left-aligned + 2rem tall + 1rem left margin (off-center intentionally) — matches the 1rem margin inside the 4rem content height; glow-green `#85f0a8` token vs accent-yellow to avoid confusion with active-space indicator.
- Space dashboard in place of timeline when viewing a space (RoomView.tsx checks `viewType === "m.space"`, hides header, switches to "headerless" grid layout).
- Cheat toggle via `window.location.reload()` — colors are render-time, reload is the only reapply mechanism that works reliably.
- Cheat BEATS custom user colors in priority (cheat green returned first by `getUserColorOverride`).
- Inline styles for cheat/custom overrides (not classes) — timeline uses `sender-color-N` classes; overrides need higher specificity.
- Content-visibility removal was comprehensive: deleted the CSS property, the hook import, and the hook call from Entry.tsx; entries render unconditionally.
- Uniform room-list color when enabled: peach `#fecdb2` names + warm white `rgba(255,255,255,.9)` preview text (temperature contrast fixed the warm-on-warm failure).
- Settings scope: code_block_line_wrap global-only is most debatable (user hasn't objected), custom_notification_sound has no UI (pre-existing gap).
- Startup retry on ECONNREFUSED postponed (distinct from 401 auth fail) — low-hanging fix, depends on determining retry semantics with the user.

**Actions Taken**:
- `web/src/api/media.ts`: new `getRoomAccentColor(roomID)` using stable hash, returned as `color-mix(in oklab, accent 70%, #f8f8f2)` softened value; `getUserColor` recolor for right-panel pastels; applied to room names and member names.
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.css` / `Entry.tsx`: full-width hover/selected highlight (removed margins, border-radius), hairline separators `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(254,205,178,.08)` via `&:not(.hidden) ~ &`, 4rem `align-items: center`, title 1.1875rem, active-room glow pill (2rem tall, green `--room-glow-*` tokens), conversation-kind glyph placement after name, ellipsis wrapping, removed `content-visibility: auto` / `contain: strict` and useContentVisibility hook.
- `web/src/icons/modern/messages-square.svg`: new icon for named rooms.
- `web/src/ui/SpaceView.tsx` / `.css`: dashboard layout with avatar masthead, topic, meta line, quick-action buttons, expandable sections (Spaces/Rooms/Members/SpaceAdder), child rows with avatar/accent-name/topic/member-count/admin-buttons/join-button (green tinted, join→open room), member grid 30-cap + "Show all N members", back button under 45rem width, RoomStateStore integration for member loading.
- `web/src/ui/RoomView.tsx` / `.css`: check `viewType === "m.space"`, render SpaceView in chat pane, hide RoomViewHeader, apply `.headerless` grid template.
- `web/src/ui/CheatConsole.tsx` / `.css`: modal with D-pad/B/A buttons, SELECT/START pills, sequence chip readout, Backspace deletes, Escape closes.
- `web/src/util/cheats.ts`: cheat registry, tail-matching logic, localStorage persistence, Konami code support, `raam-green` cheat toggle.
- `web/src/icons/modern/gamepad-2.svg`: new cheat indicator icon.
- `web/src/api/media.ts`: `getUserColorOverride()` checking cheat registry before custom colors, applied via inline style in TimelineEvent.tsx / ReplyBody.tsx (not classes).
- `web/src/ui/RoomList.tsx` / `.css`: space-rail footer (sticky bottom, profile/settings buttons disabled with no room, glowing gamepad indicator while cheats active), layout flex column.
- Settings scope reorganization: 15 preferences moved to anyGlobalContext (code_block_theme, code_block_line_wrap, pointer_cursor, uniform_room_list_color, custom_css, favicon, small_replies, show_date_separators, upload_dialog, map_provider, leaflet_tile_template, gif_provider, message_context_menu, ctrl_enter_send, ctrl_arrow_reply), category field on all, preferences.ts declares all categories.
- `web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: aligned `tauri` 2.10.0 → 2.11 (locked 2.11.5) with `@tauri-apps/api` 2.11.1.
- `web/src/util/clipboard.ts`: new utility `copyToClipboard()` with navigator.clipboard try/catch → hidden-textarea execCommand fallback, replacing 3 bare `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` sites.
- All files: `npx tsc -b` and `npx eslint` clean, zero-lint baseline established.

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Platform fixes (links + clipboard) untested by user so far — need confirmation YouTube click works + Share→Copy hits clipboard. If links still fail, the opener error path needs instrumentation.
- Auth retry on ECONNREFUSED (startup race post-shell-rebuild) is pending — Vite full reload (touch index.html) works around it, but a proper frontend retry is the next action.
- Custom_css per-room removal flagged but not reverted — one-line edit if user wants it back.
- Cheat system deliberately separate from preferences (no UI, localStorage-only, different inheritance) — keeps it lightweight and intentionally hidden.
- Right-panel sender-color contrast question resolved: new pastels from `getUserColor` are high-luminance (capped at L 80%), reading better on warm backgrounds.
- Virtualization gotcha documented: WebKit defers repaints of `content-visibility: auto` / `contain: strict` boxes, causing multi-room highlight lag during fast room nav. Plain rendering trades memory for reliability.

## 2026-08-06 16:36

**Session Summary**: Built a 3-tier URL preview system for received messages (embedded via `m.url_previews`/`com.beeper.linkpreviews` → homeserver `/preview_url` endpoint → hidden-webview OG tag scraper triggered by click). Debugged Cloudflare blocking (TLS fingerprint, not IP/UA — Synapse cache explains intermittent success). Built Cmd+K quick-switcher (Alfred/Raycast-style 48rem panel, 10-result room search ranked by recency/prefix/substring/subsequence, pinned Settings/New-room actions). Iterated visual design to approved state: modal edge idiom (hairline ring + dark seam for warm surfaces), quick-switcher reduced frosting via `:has()` scoped override, section dividers at 40% color-mix opacity. New preference `auto_load_encrypted_url_previews` (default false, privacy). Dependencies: `percent-encoding = "2"` (Cargo.toml), `@tauri-apps/api` (package.json). All work UNCOMMITTED.

**Decisions Made**:
- Three-tier preview fallback: (1) embedded array `.length` check (Beeper senders embed empty `[]`), (2) homeserver auto for <48h old, click for older, (3) hidden-webview collector via `location.hash` fragment channel (Rust polls `webview.url()`). Click-only for tier 3 — auto JS execution on arbitrary URLs is security risk.
- Encrypted-room URLs never auto-fetch by default — leaks reading activity to homeserver. Preference-gated.
- Quick-switcher reduced frosting scoped via `:has()` selector (blur 3px, 12% dim — lighter than the app-wide 20px/50%) rather than global override.
- Modal edge treatment: solid borders invisible on warm surfaces; use `inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,.18)` (light hairline) + `0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,.6)` (dark seam) + shadows + faint accent underglow.
- Divider lines 40% color-mix opacity to optically match small label text weight.

**Actions Taken**:
- `web/src/ui/urlpreview/FetchedURLPreview.tsx`: three-tier system with `.length` check, `AUTO_LOAD_PREVIEW_MAX_AGE` from TimelineEvent, click-to-load chip for homeserver fails, `fetch_og_tags` Tauri command integration, `og:image` branch on `mxc://` prefix, onError collapse for broken images, title===description dedup.
- `web/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: `fetch_og_tags` Tauri command spawning hidden WebKit window, collector script harvesting OG tags from DOM, `location.hash = "__OGRESULT__=" + percent-encoded JSON` channel, Rust polling `webview.url()` for result.
- `web/src/api/types/preferences/preferences.ts`: new `auto_load_encrypted_url_previews` preference, `allowedContexts: anyContext`, default false.
- `web/src/ui/QuickSwitcher.tsx` + `.css`: 48rem panel at 11vh, 1.375rem search input, ROOMS section (10 results, recency rank), ACTIONS (Settings, New room), arrow/Enter/Escape navigation.
- `web/src/ui/modal/opener.tsx`: `modals.quickSwitcher(store, mainScreen)` integration.
- `web/src/ui/keybindings.ts`: `"Super+k"` binding opening quick-switcher (Ctrl+K still focuses sidebar search).
- `web/src/ui/QuickSwitcher.css`: modal edge idiom CSS (hairline + seam + shadow + underglow); scoped reduced frosting via `:has()`; section dividers via `--quick-switcher-divider`.
- `web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: added `percent-encoding = "2"`.
- `web/package.json`: added `@tauri-apps/api`.
- `.claude/learnings/url-previews.md` written (architecture + gotchas).

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Printables.com Cloudflare block is TLS-fingerprint-based (curl/Node also fail), not IP/UA. Only real browser engine passes. Cache expiry explains Element's "showed preview then didn't" — Synapse cached one successful scrape, cache expired, then failed.
- Webview collector `setInterval` worked in testing; if timeouts appear, make window visible-but-offscreen.
- gomuks backend `/url_preview` just proxies homeserver `/_matrix/client/v1/media/preview_url` (`pkg/gomuks/media.go GetURLPreview`).

## 2026-07-28 15:23

**Session Summary**: A very large visual-design iteration session on the Tauri macOS app (`npx tauri dev` from `web/`, verified only via Vite HMR log lines plus the user's own eyes and two pasted screenshots — Claude still cannot screenshot the Tauri window itself), plus two functional fixes and one new feature. Covered: room-list-vs-chat-pane contrast and pane stacking order, several palette reversals ending on Ferra warm surfaces with a cool near-black chat pane and saturated candy sender colours, room header retokenization and growth, chat text hierarchy rework, header icon resizing, right-panel raise/slide-in, a reduced-motion diagnosis and fix, a dark-surface shadow-visibility diagnosis and fix, a new "ignore reduce motion" preference, a drag-and-drop bug fix, a reaction-hover-tooltip feature, room topic/name tooltips, a full settings-page redesign, a toggle-component redesign, a modal edge/backdrop fix, a corner-radius reversal, and a Cmd+, keyboard shortcut. All work is UNCOMMITTED on branch `main`; a commit is being made right after this checkpoint. `npx tsc -b` and `npx eslint` were clean on every file touched; 11 pre-existing eslint errors remain in files NOT touched this session and are not attributable to this work.

**Decisions Made**:
- Gave the room list and space rail their own high-alpha tints instead of relying on macOS vibrancy alone: `--room-list-background`/`--room-list-background-overlay` were both `transparent` in Tauri, so the sidebar's tone was purely the wallpaper blur and could accidentally match the opaque chat pane exactly depending on the desktop background.
- Replaced the chat pane's sideways-blurring drop shadow (`0 6px 20px`) with an inset recess shadow on its left edge, plus a raise shadow + `z-index: 3` on the room-list wrapper — root cause of the "chat reads as on top" look was the chat pane having no left margin (flush against the room list) so its old shadow blurred onto the room list instead of separating from it.
- Palette went through several user-driven reversals (Ferra warm -> neutral graphite "to cool it down and get the font right" -> back to Ferra with candy pastel accents -> candy *saturated* accents including a real red) before landing on: Ferra warm surfaces, warm off-white body text, a cool near-black chat pane, saturated candy sender colours.
- Tokenised room header height as `--room-header-height` (was hardcoded `3.5rem` in three separate files) rather than fixing the value in place, so the header could be grown to `4.75rem` in Tauri from one place; added `position: relative; z-index: 1` because the header is an earlier grid item than the timeline and its cast shadow would otherwise paint underneath the messages.
- Rebalanced chat text hierarchy: body moved off Ferra's saturated peach (`#fecdb2`) to a warm off-white (`#efe7e1`), secondary text off cool lavender (`#d1d1e0`) to warm gray (`#b8aca6`), and the sender name stepped DOWN in size (`.875rem`, weight 600, `.015em` tracking) to read as a label over the message rather than competing with it — hue alone wasn't enough separation when both lines were the same size and equally chromatic.
- Scoped the cool near-black chat palette (`--background-color: #16181f`) to `div.room-view` only so sidebars keep their Ferra warmth, accepting that this makes the composer (`#1e212a`) lighter than the pane, breaking the earlier "recessed input is always the darkest surface" assumption, and that a black recess shadow becomes nearly invisible on near-black.
- Replaced filled Material icons in the room header with new outlined ones AND shrunk the glyph to `1.25rem` inside the unchanged `2.5rem` tap target — concluded the oversized glyph, not just its fill style, was driving the "clunky" look, since scaling an SVG down also thins its stroke.
- Right panel raised with a mirrored shadow + `z-index: 3` and pointed its background at `--room-list-background` (matches the room list, which shares its window-edge vibrancy situation) rather than at the room-header token, which composites over the opaque chat pane and lands darker despite sharing a token name.
- Diagnosed that NO animation was possible on this machine: macOS "Reduce motion" is ON (`defaults read com.apple.universalaccess reduceMotion` -> `1`), and every reduced-motion CSS rule in the app said `animation: none`/`transition: none`, so the requested right-panel animation could never have appeared regardless of what was written. Changed the reduced-motion branch to a 120ms opacity fade instead of no motion at all, on the principle that reduce-motion should not mean "remove all feedback."
- Diagnosed that shadows were invisible on the near-black chat pane because a black shadow has nothing left to darken on an already near-black surface; replaced both raise shadows with a light edge line plus a dark blur (`1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,.07), 8px 0 24px rgba(0,0,0,.6)` and its mirror).
- Built the "ignore reduce motion" escape hatch as an attribute on `<html>` (`data-ignore-reduce-motion`, toggled via a `useEffect` in `StylePreferences.tsx`) rather than trying to conditionally suppress the media query, because CSS cannot un-match `prefers-reduced-motion` — every affected rule now requires the attribute to be ABSENT. Also patched the JS `matchMedia` check in `MainScreen.tsx`'s `activeRoomReducer` so the toggle isn't half-applied on narrow/mobile layouts.
- Fixed drag-and-drop from CleanShot X by setting `"dragDropEnabled": false` in `tauri.conf.json` rather than touching the composer's HTML5 handlers (already correct) — the installed CLI's config schema states this must be false for HTML5 drag-and-drop to reach the frontend; it defaults to `true`, and Tauri's native handler was consuming the drop first.
- Built reaction-hover tooltips on the existing `get_related_events` RPC (relation type `m.annotation`, the same call `EventEditHistory.tsx` already makes for `m.replace`) rather than changing the Go backend, since the backend aggregates `m.reaction` events into bare counts and discards senders (`FillReactionCounts`, `pkg/hicli/database/event.go:225`) and changing that would require a sidecar rebuild. Fetches lazily on first hover; cache invalidated by a `countSignature` of `key:count` pairs. Required moving the reaction pill's ellipsis-clipping `overflow: hidden` from `div.reaction` to a new inner `div.reaction-inner` so it wouldn't clip an absolutely-positioned tooltip.
- Settings page redesign: corrected an early draft that made the room name the headline (read as "settings for this room only") to a "Settings" headline with the room appearing only as a small inline avatar chip inside explanatory sentence text.
- Preference matrix regrouped from four flat, ambiguously-labelled columns (two both called "This room") into a 2x2 with spanning group headers ("Everywhere" / "Only in {room}") over "All devices"/"This device", with both header rows sticky via a `--group-head-height` token.
- Room-scoped half of the matrix given a recessed darker band (`--settings-room-wash: rgba(0,0,0,.26)` for cells, an opaque color-mix for sticky headers so rows can't scroll through them) — the first attempt (`rgba(127,127,127,.07)`) was invisible on an already-gray card, per direct user feedback.
- Dropped the settings modal to `border-radius: 0` early in the session (citing the user's standing square-corner preference), then reversed to `.625rem`/`.375rem` after the user flagged "sharp edges" twice — concluded the square-corner preference is specifically about panes that butt against each other and the window edge, not modals that float over a blurred backdrop where a 90° corner reads as harsh.
- Added `Super+,`/`Ctrl+,` to open settings, matching the user's explicit request for "the Mac native keyboard shortcut."

**Actions Taken**:
- `web/src/index.css`: sidebar tint tokens, chat-pane recess shadow, room-header shadow token, right-panel raise shadow + background token, reduced-motion rule for the right panel gated on `data-ignore-reduce-motion` being absent, modal overlay `backdrop-filter: blur(var(--modal-backdrop-blur)) saturate(115%)` with a `0px`/`20px` token split on `html[data-tauri]`, dim lightened from `.75` to `.5` black.
- `web/src/ui/MainScreen.css` / `MainScreen.tsx`: `--room-header-height` consumption, mobile-slide reduced-motion rule gated the same way, `activeRoomReducer` `matchMedia` check patched for the ignore-reduce-motion escape hatch.
- `web/src/ui/util/ResizeHandle.css` / `ResizeHandle.tsx`: reduced-motion glow rule gated the same way.
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.css` / `RoomList.tsx` / `FakeSpace.tsx`: section-chevron reduced-motion rule gated the same way; sidebar tint application.
- Room header CSS/TSX (three files touched to retokenize `--room-header-height`, exact file names not itemized in the brief): height, title size, avatar size, shadow, icon set swap and resize, `title` attributes added to room name and topic for hover-reachable full text.
- `web/src/preferences.ts`: new "Ignore reduce motion" preference, `allowedContexts: globalDeviceSpecific`, default `false`.
- `StylePreferences.tsx`: `useEffect` toggling `data-ignore-reduce-motion` on `<html>`.
- Reaction pill component + CSS: `div.reaction-inner` added as the clipping boundary; new hover-triggered fetch via `get_related_events` (`m.annotation`) with lazy load and `countSignature`-keyed cache invalidation.
- `web/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: added `"dragDropEnabled": false`.
- `SettingsView.tsx` / `SettingsView.css`: full rewrite — masthead, section cards with six new outlined icons (sliders-horizontal, palette, braces, key, log-out, door-open), 2x2 preference matrix with sticky spanning headers, room-scoped recessed band, secondary descriptive text surfaced under each preference row, `.set` highlight switched from `background-color` to a layered `background-image` gradient.
- `web/src/icons/modern/`: six new icons added for settings.
- `opener.tsx`: settings modal given its own `boxClass: "settings-view-modal"`.
- `Toggle.css`: rewritten — `2.5em x 1.375em` filled recessed track (was `3.5em x 2em` outlined), white knob with its own shadow at both states, travel via `translate` (was `margin-left`), "on" state uses `--accent-glow-color`, respects the ignore-reduce-motion pattern, `--disabled-color` kept as a fallback.
- `web/src/ui/keybindings.ts`: added `"Super+,"` / `"Ctrl+,"` to `keyDownMap`, opening `modals.settings(this.activeRoom)` via `window.openNestableModal`.
- Verified `npx tsc -b` clean and `npx eslint` clean on every file touched throughout; confirmed the 11 pre-existing eslint errors in `WebAuthLogin.tsx`, `MessageComposer.tsx`, `useSecondaryItems.tsx`, `TimelineEvent.tsx` are unrelated to this session's changes (the `TimelineEvent.tsx` ones sit in code not modified this session, just at shifted line numbers).

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Two CSS specificity bugs were caught and fixed mid-session, worth remembering as a pattern: (1) building settings section cards on `--room-list-background-overlay` would have left them with no surface at all, since `index.css` forces that token `transparent` inside `html[data-tauri]` to let vibrancy show through the room list — fixed by deriving surfaces from `--background-color` via `color-mix` instead; (2) `> div.scope-room_account { padding-left: .5rem }` was being reset to zero by a later `> div.preference { padding: .5rem 0 }` shorthand at equal specificity — fixed by switching to `padding-block`. A related third case: the `.set` highlight was moved from `background-color` to a `background-image` gradient specifically so it layers over the room-scoped band instead of competing with it at equal specificity.
- The reduced-motion diagnosis (rule 10 in the brief) is a good example of "root cause, not just a fix" — the user responds well to being told an animation was blocked by an OS accessibility setting rather than just silently making one appear.
- The composer-lighter-than-pane and shadow-now-invisible consequences of the cool-dark-chat-pane decision were flagged as known follow-on effects, not fully resolved — see Next Actions in current.md.
- The right panel's saturated sender colours against its still-warm background (~3.1-4.2:1, under the 4.5:1 AA threshold for member names) is a contrast regression introduced by this session's colour work and is carried forward as an open question rather than fixed immediately.
- Claude still cannot screenshot the Tauri window directly; this session's visual verification leaned more heavily than before on the user pasting two actual screenshots, which is a meaningfully better feedback loop than the previous "Vite HMR + user's eyes only" pattern.

**Session Summary**: A large frontend visual redesign of the Tauri macOS app, plus one functional bug fix. Fixed a dev-server port collision that had been silently loading a different project's app into the Seabug window. Implemented full macOS vibrancy/native window chrome (transparent window, sidebar effect, private API), replaced the earlier overlaid-titlebar approach with a solid full-width title bar, restyled the room/chat panes as floating square cards with gaps and shadows modelled on the Reeder RSS app, lightened the chat surface for contrast, split the room list into collapsible Rooms/Direct-messages sections, introduced a new hand-authored outlined icon set for the sidebar and space rail, added yellow glow accents to the active-space indicator and pane resize handles, and fixed a real bug where external links did nothing inside the webview. All work is UNCOMMITTED on branch `main`.

**Decisions Made**:
- Pin Vite dev port to 6173 with `strictPort: true`: the previous hardcoded `devUrl` (5173) plus Vite's silent port-walking meant the Tauri window could load an entirely different local project's dev server — this happened and the user caught it. `strictPort` makes the failure loud instead of silent.
- Full macOS vibrancy over CSS-only: user explicitly chose native vibrancy (`macOSPrivateApi: true`, transparent window, `windowEffects: sidebar`) and explicitly waived the App Store distribution concern ("this is basically a private app for me").
- Verify Tauri config option names against the installed CLI's JSON schema (`web/node_modules/@tauri-apps/cli/config.schema.json`) rather than recalling from memory, since Tauri config surface changes across versions.
- Solid title bar instead of overlay: the prior overlaid-titlebar left a "harsh edge" where the floating chat card's `margin-top: 28px` created a hard boundary line with nothing structural above it. A full solid title bar (2rem tall, matching the standard macOS titlebar height so traffic lights center without a `trafficLightPosition` override) replaced it.
- Title bar implemented as `position:fixed` + `top` offset on `main.matrix-main`, not a grid row: the responsive layout at max-width 45rem uses three 100%-width grid columns and slides via translate; a spanning grid row would have broken that.
- Pane treatment modelled on Reeder (per user screenshot): floating cards separated by gaps + shadow rather than slabs sharing borders. Square corners, not rounded — user explicitly said "I don't want it to be curved" after seeing an initial rounded version. Top margin removed (flush against title bar) per user request ("flush those up"), gap kept only on right/bottom.
- Sidebar/space-rail backgrounds made translucent so vibrancy shows through, but reading surfaces (chat/timeline) stay fully opaque by design so text contrast never depends on the user's wallpaper.
- Chat surface lightened (`--background-color` #38343d, up from #2b292d) per user request for background contrast; composer background moved darker (#2f2c34) in the same change so it still reads as a recessed input against the now-lighter pane.
- Room list grouped into Rooms / Direct messages using `room.dm_user_id` — the same field `DirectChatSpace.include()` already uses — so the new grouping can never disagree with the existing DM pseudo-space logic. Ordering changed from one global recency list to per-group recency (not yet confirmed with user as desired).
- New outlined icon set (`web/src/icons/modern/`) added alongside (not replacing) the existing filled Material Symbols icons, because the old filled glyphs stretched across an entire 35px tile were the source of the "big and blocky" look the user reported; only the sidebar/space rail were repointed at the new set.
- Space rail widened to 5.5rem (from 4.5rem), scoped to `html[data-tauri]` only: macOS traffic lights run to ~66pt from the window edge, and the old rail width was just barely too narrow, making the controls appear to overhang into the room list. Not applied to plain-browser use since there are no window controls there.
- Yellow glow accent (#f5d76e, the Ferra palette yellow) chosen for the active-space indicator and resize handles as a shared, reusable token set rather than one-off colors.
- Added `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` (+ Rust `tauri-plugin-opener`) to fix dead external links, rather than changing the Go backend's HTML sanitizer, since the `target="_blank"` behavior in `pkg/hicli/html.go` is otherwise reasonable and the fix belongs on the client side that actually lacks a place to open a new tab.
- The link interceptor deliberately excludes `matrix:` URIs (already handled in-app) and same-origin links (they point at the gomuks backend for media/downloads and the system browser has no session cookie for them) — a known gap, not yet resolved.

**Actions Taken**:
- `web/vite.config.ts`: added `server.port: 6173`, `server.strictPort: true`.
- `web/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: `devUrl` -> `http://localhost:6173`; added `app.macOSPrivateApi: true`; window config gained `transparent: true`, `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"`, `hiddenTitle: true`, `windowEffects: { effects: ["sidebar"], state: "followsWindowActiveState", radius: 10 }`.
- `web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: added the `macos-private-api` Tauri feature; added `tauri-plugin-opener = "2"`.
- `web/index.html`: extended the existing inline module script to set `document.documentElement.dataset.tauri = "true"` when `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` exists.
- `web/src/ui/MainScreen.tsx`: added `<div className="app-titlebar" data-tauri-drag-region/>` before `{mainContent}`.
- `web/src/ui/MainScreen.css`: `div.app-titlebar` hidden by default, becomes a fixed full-width bar (`height: var(--titlebar-height)`, `background-color: var(--titlebar-background)`, `z-index: 4`) inside `html[data-tauri]`; `main.matrix-main` gets `top: var(--titlebar-height)`.
- `web/src/index.css`: added `--pane-gap`, `--pane-radius`, `--pane-shadow` tokens; gave `div.room-view` and `div.right-panel` opaque backgrounds, margin-based gaps, radius, and shadow inside `html[data-tauri]`; made sidebar backgrounds translucent (`--room-list-background`, `--space-list-background-overlay`, etc.) and forced `html`/`body` background to transparent; retuned dark-mode tokens `--background-color`, `--composer-background-color`, `--timeline-hover-bg-color`, `--timeline-highlight-hover-bg-color`, `--timeline-jump-hover-bg-color`; added `--accent-glow-color`/`--accent-glow-near`/`--accent-glow-far` tokens; added `--space-bar-width` token (4.5rem default, 5.5rem in Tauri).
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.tsx`: grouped the room list into collapsible Rooms/Direct-messages sections keyed on `room.dm_user_id`; removed the `reverseMap` import in favor of walking `roomList` backwards per group; sections with all rooms filtered out return null; added real `<button>` headers with `aria-expanded`, icon, label, rotating chevron; collapse state persisted to `localStorage` key `seabug.collapsed_room_list_sections` with a safe fallback to expanded; imports modern chevron-down/user/users icons.
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/RoomList.css`: resized rail glyphs to `1.375rem` inside the `2.5rem` tap target; restyled tiles (`border-radius: .625rem`, margin, `position: relative`); dropped the squircle `clip-path` on space avatars; added an `&.active::before` left-edge pill indicator recolored to the glow yellow with a two-layer box-shadow glow; switched the hardcoded rail width to `var(--space-bar-width)`.
- `web/src/ui/roomlist/FakeSpace.tsx`: imports modern home/user/bell/hash icons.
- New directory `web/src/icons/modern/`: `home.svg`, `user.svg`, `users.svg`, `bell.svg`, `hash.svg`, `chevron-down.svg` (24px grid, outlined stroke style).
- `web/src/ui/util/ResizeHandle.tsx`: added `isDragging` state, set on mousedown/mouseup, exposed as a `dragging` class.
- `web/src/ui/util/ResizeHandle.css`: rewritten so the hit area stays invisible and a thin `::after` bar lights up on hover/drag with the glow-yellow tokens, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`; `z-index: 2` added so the glow reads above pane shadows.
- `web/package.json`/`package-lock.json`: added `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` `^2.5.4` as the project's first Tauri JS runtime dependency.
- `web/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`: registered `.plugin(tauri_plugin_opener::init())`.
- `web/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`: added `"opener:allow-open-url"` permission.
- New file `web/src/util/externallinks.ts`: `handleExternalLinks()` — a delegated document click listener that opens `http:`/`https:`/`mailto:` links via the Tauri opener when running inside Tauri, no-ops in the browser, and skips `matrix:` URIs, already-prevented clicks, non-left-clicks, and same-origin links.
- `web/src/main.tsx`: calls `handleExternalLinks()` before `createRoot`.
- `web/src/vite-env.d.ts`: added `__TAURI_INTERNALS__?: unknown` to the Window interface.
- Verified `npx tsc -b` and `npx eslint` clean after each change; confirmed the Rust rebuild succeeded (`tauri-plugin-opener v2.5.4` compiled, "Finished dev profile in 10.87s") and the backend/webview relaunched successfully.

**Context/Thoughts**:
- The port collision was a real bug the user caught, not something Claude self-diagnosed — worth remembering that hardcoded dev URLs paired with tools that silently fall back to another port are a recurring risk class.
- An unverified concern remains: `div.room-view` carries `contain: strict`, and it's unconfirmed whether an element's own box-shadow paints outside its own paint-containment clip. If the floating panes show a gap but look flat with no shadow, this is the likely cause.
- Claude could not visually inspect the running app this session: `screencapture` fails (no Screen Recording permission for the terminal), chrome-devtools MCP couldn't attach, and `osascript`/System Events reports 0 windows for the transparent Tauri window (an Accessibility quirk of transparent windows). The working substitute was confirming the webview stayed alive via `lsof` on the established WebKit connection to port 6173, combined with Vite HMR and the user's own eyes — this loop worked well but means none of this session's visual claims are self-verified by Claude.
- The user's last request at pause — "some contrast on the reading screen" — was not yet clarified; the current hypothesis is to darken room-header/composer chrome relative to the message area, but that has not been confirmed with the user.
- Drag-drop image upload (carried over from a previous session) was not touched this session; the untested hypothesis is that Tauri's native OS-level file-drop handler swallows the drop before the webview sees it, since `dragDropEnabled` is not set anywhere and Tauri's default may apply.
- A Bash PreToolUse hook in this environment rejects some compound/looping shell commands (e.g., `for` loops using `lsof`); python3 one-liners or separate single-purpose calls were used instead.

**Session Summary**: Finalized app icon with custom lobster/seabug image. Iterated through multiple icon versions until finding the right one (seabug.png with transparency). Regenerated all icon sizes and formats (PNG, icns). Confirmed production build shows the icon correctly. Discussed future mobile support - Tauri 2.0 supports iOS/Android, and matrix-rust-sdk is the planned backend approach for cross-platform support.

**Decisions Made**:
- matrix-rust-sdk for mobile: Will replace Go sidecar for iOS/Android support, runs natively in Tauri's Rust layer
- Production build for icon: Dev mode uses cached icon, production build required to see custom icon

**Actions Taken**:
- Regenerated icons from seabug.png (RGBA with transparency)
- Built production Seabug.app with new icon
- Confirmed icon appears correctly in dock

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Tauri dev mode never shows custom icons - this is expected behavior
- For mobile, Go sidecar won't work - need matrix-rust-sdk or similar
- Element X uses matrix-rust-sdk, so it's a proven approach
- Other backend options: matrix-js-sdk (JS), WASM, gomobile (complex)

## 2026-02-18 20:05

**Session Summary**: Major visual redesign of the gomuks frontend. Applied user's custom "Ferra" warm color theme from their Element themes repo. Changed fonts to Lato at 14px. Redesigned room list with better spacing and alignment. Restructured message composer with icons below text input. Added faded timestamps and thinner scrollbars. Implemented custom user color feature with right-click color picker (using react-colorful). Added "Hide/Show images" toggle to message context menu. Changed preferences defaults (show_media_previews: true, show_hidden_events: false). Attempted drag-drop image upload on composer (needs testing). Renamed app to "Seabug" and added custom lobster icon.

**Decisions Made**:
- Lato font over Inter/Fira Code: cleaner look, good readability
- Ferra theme colors: warm oranges/corals (#fecdb2 text, #ffa07a accent) on dark backgrounds
- Three-tone background gradient: spaces bar darkest, room list dark, messages lightest
- Custom user colors stored in localStorage: simple persistence without backend changes
- react-colorful for color wheel: lightweight, works well

**Actions Taken**:
- Updated index.css with Ferra color variables and font changes
- Added Google Fonts link for Lato in index.html
- Restyled RoomList.css: wider space bar, room entry alignment, preview text sizing
- Restyled MessageComposer.css: icons below text, smaller/faded icons, larger send button
- Added 50% opacity to timestamps in TimelineEvent.css
- Added thin scrollbar styles globally (6px)
- Created custom user color system in media.ts (localStorage persistence)
- Added UserColorCard component in TimelineEvent.tsx with color picker
- Added react-colorful dependency
- Added "Hide/Show images" toggle in useSecondaryItems.tsx
- Changed show_media_previews default to true, show_hidden_events to false
- Added drag/drop handlers to MessageComposer.tsx
- Renamed productName and window title to "Seabug" in tauri.conf.json
- Generated all icon sizes from lobster image (RGBA conversion required for Tauri)

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Tauri icons must be RGBA format (not RGB) - build will fail otherwise
- Tauri dev mode doesn't show custom icons - need production build to see them
- Drag/drop on composer may need more testing - was inconsistent during dev
- The app is now distinctly styled and feels like a custom Matrix client

## 2026-02-18 17:15

**Session Summary**: Built a native macOS app using Tauri to wrap the existing React frontend, with the Go backend running as a managed sidecar process. Solved authentication issues by creating a custom WebAuthLogin React component since Tauri's webview doesn't trigger HTTP Basic Auth dialogs like browsers do. Implemented proper lifecycle management so the backend starts with the app and stops when the app closes.

**Decisions Made**:
- Use Tauri over Electron: lighter weight (~10MB vs ~150MB), better performance, uses native webview
- Keep Go backend for now: works well, can migrate to JS later if desired
- Sidecar approach: Go binary bundled with app, spawned on launch, killed on exit
- Custom auth component: Tauri webview doesn't handle HTTP Basic Auth prompts, so we built a React login form

**Actions Taken**:
- Installed Rust via rustup
- Added Tauri to the web project with shell plugin for sidecar support
- Configured tauri.conf.json for Vite dev server integration
- Set up Go binary as sidecar in binaries/gomuks-aarch64-apple-darwin
- Modified lib.rs to spawn sidecar on setup and kill on exit (with proper Rust lifecycle management)
- Updated gomuks config.yaml to allow tauri:// origin and enable insecure_cookies for dev
- Created WebAuthLogin.tsx component with matching CSS
- Modified rpc.ts doAuth() to support credential passing
- Modified client.ts to add retryAuthWithCredentials()
- Modified App.tsx to show WebAuthLogin when AUTH_REQUIRED

**Context/Thoughts**:
- Tauri v2 uses `tauri://localhost` as origin on macOS
- The shell plugin's sidecar spawn returns a CommandChild that must be stored and killed on exit
- Vite proxy handles forwarding /_gomuks/* to localhost:29325 in dev mode
- Session cookies from browser don't transfer to Tauri webview (separate cookie stores)
- For production build, will need to bundle the Go binary properly with correct target triple

## 2026-02-18 12:30

**Session Summary**: Got the gomuks fork fully building and running locally. Installed libolm dependency via Homebrew, configured CGO flags for the Go build, verified both the Go backend and web frontend compile successfully, and confirmed the application runs at localhost:29325.

**Decisions Made**:
- Treat backend and frontend as unified system (gomuks architecture requires both to function)

**Actions Taken**:
- Installed libolm via Homebrew
- Configured CGO_CFLAGS and CGO_LDFLAGS for libolm headers/libs
- Built full Go project successfully
- Built web frontend with Vite
- Started gomuks and verified it runs on localhost:29325

**Context/Thoughts**:
- libolm is deprecated upstream but still works
- Web frontend is Vite + TypeScript + React (in web/src/)
- Ready to start actual frontend redesign work
